														<img title="Dog in yard" alt="Dog in yard" src="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/Images/Articles/a_5reasons1.jpg" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="183" align="right" border="0" /> Dealing with pet waste is one of those topics that every pet owner 
must deal with but no one likes to talk about. The fact is that the majority of 
community and neighborhood pet problems result from the inappropriate handling 
of pet waste. In addition, pet waste is the greatest source of potential health 
risk for your pet and your family. This article will highlight the five most 
important reasons to properly dispose of pet waste and will also give you some 
tips and products to make this chore easier. 
<p><span class="Verdana75pt" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">#1. 
Disease Control</span></p><p>There are several very common diseases that can be transmitted to dogs, cats 
and people through feces. These include giardia, roundworms, salmonella, and 
Ecoli. In addition, your dog can spread or contract parvovirus or coronavirus 
through infected feces. All of these diseases are very serious and common and 
every effort should be made by pet owners to keep their pets and family away 
from potentially infected feces. One of the easiest ways to do this is to 
install an in-ground stool digester like the <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_Display.cfm?siteid=12&amp;pCatId=570">Doggie Dooley</a>. These digesters work like mini septic systems, 
safely breaking down feces and then allowing the residue to harmlessly sink into 
the surrounding soil. These handy little gadgets are one of the best ways that 
I've ever found to deal with dog or cat waste. 
</p><p><span class="Verdana75pt" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">#2. 
Make your Yard more Useable</span></p><p>Nobody likes to walk through a yard that is hiding "doggie land mines." If 
you and your children are afraid to use your yard because of the dog, then you 
are wasting one of your biggest time and financial investments. In addition, the 
pets will get less interactive exercise and suffer as well. Once or twice a day 
'scooping' off your yard with a shovel or <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_Display.cfm?siteid=12&amp;pCatId=1080">Grabber</a> pet waste shovel will only take a couple of minutes and 
make it a place where everyone enjoys spending time. 
</p><p><span class="Verdana75pt" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">#3. Fly 
Control</span></p><p> Flies will consume and lay eggs in feces. These same flies will 
then come into your house and then spread disease as they pause on your counter 
and food. Need I say more about keeping feces cleaned up to prevent this cycle? 
</p><p><span class="Verdana75pt" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">#4. 
Responsible Pet Ownership</span></p><p>Your responsibility to clean up after your pet doesn't end when your dog 
leaves your yard. There are probably fewer things that aggravate neighbors more 
than a dog that 'goes' in their yard. Pet owners need to clean up after their 
pet every time they go to the bathroom. Period. No exceptions. If you are 
walking in the woods and your dog goes, then bury it. If you are in a park or 
neighborhood, pick it up with a plastic bag.  Don't make your responsibility somebody 
else's problem. </p></div>
